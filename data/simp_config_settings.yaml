# === simp::runlevel ===
# The default system runlevel (1-5).

# === simp::yum::repo::local_os_updates::servers ===
# The YUM server(s) for SIMP-managed, OS Update packages.

- "%{hiera('simp_options::puppet::server')}"

# === simp::yum::repo::local_simp::servers ===

# The DNS domain search string.
#
# Remember to put these in the appropriate order for your environment!
simp_options::dns::search:

# === simp_options::dns::servers ===
# A list of DNS servers for the managed hosts.
#
# If the first entry of this list is set to '127.0.0.1', then
# all clients will configure themselves as caching DNS servers
# pointing to the other entries in the list.
#
# If you have a system that's including the 'named' class and
# is *not* in this list, then you'll need to set a variable at
# the top of that node entry called $named_server to 'true'.
# This will get around the convenience logic that was put in
# place to handle the caching entries and will not attempt to
# convert your system to a caching DNS server. You'll know
# that you have this situation if you end up with a duplicate
# definition for File['/etc/named.conf'].

# === simp_options::fips ===
# Prepare system to use FIPS mode.
#
# simp_options::fips enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP modules
# can support this configuration. Enabling simp_options::fips here will enable
# FIPS on this puppet environment.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
#     FIPS mode disables the use of MD5 and may require weaker ciphers or key
#     lengths than your security policies allow.
# (2) If the system is currently in FIPS mode and you set this option to false,
#     the system will still work.  The reverse is not necessarily true.  See
#     SIMP documentation for instructions on how to safely convert a non-FIPS
#     system to a FIPS system.

# infrastructure, and thus your site security. **DO NOT** attempt to
# run multiple production systems using individual hardware clocks!
#
# For many networks, the default gateway (192.168.1.1) provides an NTP server.

# === sssd::domains ===
# A list of domains for SSSD to use.

# * When `simp_options::ldap` is true, this field should include `LDAP`.

# === svckill::mode ===
# Strategy svckill should use when it encounters undeclared services.
#
# 'enforcing' = Shut down and disable all services not listed in your
#               manifests or the exclusion file
# 'warning'   = Only report what undeclared services should be shut
#               down and disabled, without actually making the changes
#               to the system
#
# NOTICE: svckill is the mechanism that SIMP uses to comply with the
# requirement that no unauthorized services are running on your system.
# If you are fully aware of all services that need to be running on the
# system, including any custom applications, use 'enforcing'.  If you
# first need to ascertain which services should be running on the system,
# use 'warning'.
svckill::mode: warning

# === useradd::securetty ===
# A list of TTYs for which the root user can login.
#
# When useradd::securetty is an empty list, the system will satisfy FISMA
# regulations, which require root login via any TTY (including the console)
# to be disabled.  For some systems, the inability to login as root via the
# console is problematic.  In that case, you may wish to include at least
# tty0 to the list of allowed TTYs, despite the security risk.
